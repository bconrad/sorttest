Makes a list of random numbers and runs various sorts on them

Arguments:
	-l<length>
		Sets the length of the generated list (defaults to 10, can easily be >10000)
	-g<type>
		Sets the type of list generated:
		 -gs = sequential list of integers
		 -gh = shuffled list of integers
		 -gr = list of random integers
	-d
		Generates and dumps list, then exits

Currently implemented algorithms:
 - Bubblesort
 - Quicksort
 - Insertion sort

TODO:
 - Implement radix sort (I'm embarrassed about the current broken code)
 - See if there's an alternative to that damn macro
 - Select sorting algorithms by command line
